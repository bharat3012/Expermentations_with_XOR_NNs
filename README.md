# Experimentations-XOR 


# Implementation of Simple NNs
The repository contains 2 .py files .
simplest_nn.py and simplest_nn2.py , which takes random no. as input with logistic regression type neural network model with 1 hdden layer, gradient decent optimizer and cross entropy loss function.

# Implementation of XOR Gates

Used Tensorflow as a basic library to implement XOR Neural Network function.
